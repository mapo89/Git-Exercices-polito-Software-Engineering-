# Git-Exercices-polito-Software-Engineering-
Tutorial for using git for Software Engineering course of Politecnico di Torino.
## Preliminary operations
1. Create your account on github
2. Install a git client ([windows](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git#Installing-on-Windows), [linux](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git#Installing-on-Linux), [Mac](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git#Installing-on-Mac))
2. Set up git as explained [here](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/)
3. Create a new repository as explained [here](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/)

## Exercise 1

### Scenario
You are writing your master thesis and you don't want to keep the history of what done, in order to be able to track modifications and rollback if necessary.

### Main Task
1. Create a new directory and change into it.
2. Use the **init** comm and to create a Git repository in that directory.
3. Observe that there is now a **.git** directory.
4. Create a README file.
5. Look at the output of the **status** command; the README you created should appear as an untracked file.
6. Use the **add** command to add the new file to the staging area. Again, look at the output of the status command.
7. Now use the commit command to commit the contents of the staging area.
8. Create a _Chapters_ directory and add the following files to it: _intro.txt, SoA.txt, method.txt, concl.txt_ 9. Use the **add** command, but name the directory, not the individual files. Use the **status** command. See how files have been staged. Commit them.
10. Make a change to one of the files. Use the *diff* command to view the details of the change.
11. Next, add the changed file, and notice how it moves to the staging area in the status output. Also observe that the **diff** command you did before using add now gives no output. Why not? What do you have to do to see a diff of the things in the staging area?
12. Now – without committing – make another change to the same file you changed in step 10. Look at the status output, and the diff output. Notice how you can have both staged and unstaged changes, even when you’re talking about a single file. Observe the difference when you use the add command to stage the latest round of changes. Finally, commit them. You should now have started to get a  feel for the staging area.
13. Use the log command in order to see all of the commits you made so far.
14. Use the show command to look at an individual commit. How many characters of the commit identifier can you get away with typing at a minimum?
15. Make a couple more commits, at least one of which should add an extra file.

### Stretch Task
1. Use the Git **rm** command to remove a file. Look at the status afterwards. Now commit the deletion.
2. Delete another file, but this time do not use Git to do it; e.g. if you are on Linux, just use the 
normal (non - Git) **rm** command; on Windows use **del**.
3. Look at the status. Compare it to the status output you had after using the Git built-in rm command. Is anything different? After this, commit the deletion.
4. Use the Git **mv** command to move or rename a file; for example, rename README to README.txt. Look at the status. Commit the change.
5. Now do another rename, but this time using the operating system’s command to do so. How does the status look? Will you get the right outcome if you were to commit at this point? Work out how to get the status
to show that it will not lose the file, and then commit. Did Git at any point work out that you had done a 
rename?
6. Use **git help log** to find out how to get Git to display just the most recent 3 commits. Try it.
7. If you don’t remember, look back in the slides to see what the --stat option did on the **diff** command. Find out if this also works with the show command. How about the **log** command?
8. Imagine you want to see a diff that summarizes all that happened between two commit identifiers. Use the 
**diff** command, specifying two commit identifiers joined by two dots (that is, something like abc123..def456). Check the output is what you expect.

## Exercise 2
Work in the same repository of previous exercise.

### Scenario
As for exercise 1.

### Main Task
1. Run the **status** command. Notice how it tells you what branch you are in.
2. Use the **branch** command to create a new branch.
3. Use the **checkout** command to switch to it.
4. Make a couple of commits in the branch – perhaps adding a new file and/or editing existing ones.
5. Use the log command to see the latest commits. The two you just made should be at the top of the list.
6. Use the **checkout** command to switch back to the master branch. Run **log** again. Notice your commits don’t show up now. Check the files also – they should have their original contents.
7. Use the **checkout** command to switch back to your branch. Use **gitk** to take a look at the commit graph; notice it’s linear.
8. Now checkout the master branch again. Use the **merge** command to merge your branch in to it. Look for information about it having been a fast-forward merge. Look at git log, and see that there is no merge commit. Take a look in gitk and see how the DAG is linear.
9. Switch back to your branch. Make a couple more commits.
10. Switch back to master. Make a commit there, which should edit a different file from the ones you touched in your branch – to be sure there is no conflict.
11. Now merge your branch again. (Aside: you don’t need to do anything to inform Git that you only want to merge things added since your previous merge. Due to the way Git works, that kind of issue simply does not come up, unlike in early versions of Subversion).
12. Look at git log. Notice that there is a merge commit. Also look in gitk. Notice the DAG now shows how things forked, and then were joined up again by a merge commit.

### Stretch Task
1. Once again, checkout your branch. Make a couple of commits.
2. Return to your master branch. Make a commit there that changes the exact same line, or lines, as commits in your branch did.
3. Now try to merge your branch. You should get a conflict.
4. Open the file(s) that is in conflict. Search for the conflict marker. Edit the file to remove the conflict markers and resolve the conflict. 
5. Now try to commit. Notice that Git will not allow you to do this when you still have potentially unresolved conflicts. Look at the output of status too.
6. Use the add command to add the files that you have resolved conflicts in to the staging area. Then use commit to commit the merge commit.
7. Take a look at git log and gitk, and make sure things are as you expected.
8. If time allows, you may wish to...
  - Delete everything but your .git directory, then do a checkout command, to prove to yourself that this really will restore all of you current working copy.
  - Create a situation where one branch has changed a file, but the other branch has deleted it. What happens when you try to merge? How will you resolve it?
  - Look at the help page for merge, and find out how you specify a custom message for the merge commit if it is automatically generated.
  - Look at the help page for merge, and find out how to prevent Git from automatically committing the merge commit it generates, but instead give you chance to inspect it and merge it yourself.

## Exercise 3

Form group of 2 people.

### Scenario
You are a team of 2 developers working on same projects but leaving in different cities (Torino and Milano).

### Main Task
1. First, one person in the group should create a public repository using their GitHub account.
2. This same person should then follow the instructions from GitHub to add a remote. Copy the inventory folder of this project and push the repository. Do not forget the –u flag, as suggested by GitHub!
3. All of the other members of the group should then be added as collaborators, so they can commit to the repository also.
4. Next, everyone else in the group should clone the repository from GitHub. Verify that the context of the repository is what is expected.
5. One of the group members who just cloned should now make a local commit, then push it. Everyone should verify that when they pull, that commit is added to their local repository (use git log to check for it).
6. Look at each other’s git log output. Notice how the SHA-1 is the same for a given commit across every copy of the repository. Why is this important?
7. Two members of the group should now make a commit locally, and race to push it. To keep things simple, be sure to edit different files. What happens to the runner-up?
8. The runner-up should now pull. As a group, look at the output of the command. Additionally, look at the 
git log, and notice that there is a merge commit. You may also wish to view the DAG in git.
9. Repeat the last two steps a couple of times, to practice. 

### Stretch Task
1. Now create a situation where two group members both edit the same line in the same file and commit it locally. Race to push.
2. When the runner-up does a pull, they should get a merge conflict.
3. Look as a group at the file in conflict, and resolve it.
4. Use the add command to stage the fix, and then use commit to make the merge commit. Notice how this procedure is exactly the one you got used to when resolving conflicts in branches.

## Exercise 4

Work in the same group of exercise 3.

### Scenario
As exercise 3. In particular you have to focus on the testing phase, by relying on junit.

### Main Task
1. Clone this repository. One member of the team is responsible of Item class, while the other of the Inventory class.
2. Design and develop other unit tests which can be important for the two classes (you can rely on what defined in the blackbox testing exercise of previous exercise lesson). Each member works on his own and commit and push to share changes.
3. Run the tests and correct the classes or the tests until all are passed.
4. The member responsible of the Inventory class add a method to search by description and define and runs proper tests, while the other member add the field supplier and methods necessary to manage it in the Item class and define and runs proper tests.
